# IOTA IoT Security Simulation

This project demonstrates a secure data pipeline for an Internet of Things (IoT) environment using:
- **Python** scripts for data generation and forwarding
- **MQTT** for publish/subscribe messaging
- A Dockerized **IOTA Hornet Node** for decentralized data storage
- **Docker Compose** for simplified deployment

---

## üöÄ Features

1. **IoT Data Simulation**  
   - `iot_simulation.py`: Simulates sensor readings (e.g., temperature, humidity) and publishes them to designated MQTT topics.

2. **MQTT Subscriber**  
   - `mqtt_subscriber.py`: Subscribes to MQTT topics and prints incoming messages, useful for debugging data flow.

3. **MQTT to IOTA Forwarder**  
   - `mqtt_to_iota.py`: Receives IoT data via MQTT and forwards it to the IOTA Tangle by creating secure transactions.

4. **Seed & Address Generation**  
   - `generate_seed.py`: Dynamically generates an 81-character IOTA seed.
   - `generate_address.py`: Derives a new IOTA address from a given seed.

5. **Node Connectivity Testing**  
   - `node_test.py`: Tests connectivity to the IOTA node by fetching node information.

6. **Docker & Hornet Configuration**  
   - `docker-compose.yml`: Defines services to run a Hornet Node and an MQTT broker using Docker.
   - `config.json`: Provides the Hornet Node configuration (with public routes, P2P settings, etc.).

## 2. **Security & Disclaimers**
## üîí Security & Disclaimers

- **Seed Values:**  
  The code includes placeholder seeds (e.g., `"YOUR_TEST_SEED_HERE"`). Do not commit real production seeds in a public repository.

- **Configuration:**  
  This project is for demonstration and educational purposes only. No sensitive production data is exposed.
